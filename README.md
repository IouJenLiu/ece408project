# ECE 408 Project

We use GPUs to acceralate forward propagation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained using 60,000 MNIST examples (training set images) and the provided test data is 10,000 images.

To build and run the program, please see https://github.com/webgpu/ece408project for detailed information.
